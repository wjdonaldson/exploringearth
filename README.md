We go into detail about what can be done in the destinations we’ve covered while maintaining a budget. Everyone wanted to travel and not spend too much? We got you covered with everything we found to be budget friendly and exceptional, along with things that may not be worth the cheap price. 
We document our stay at locations around the world while maintaining a budgeting, so everyone can see how much you actually need to enjoy a trip out.
